The easiest part of this project: Reaching a conclusion and god mode

Problems that I had in completing this project: I had a couple head scratching moments when there were seg faults on a list access that was definitely not invalid. Turns out updating code in a .h file does get caught by my makefile, and so there was some sort of mismatch in the binaries. Just needed to make clean and recompile.
